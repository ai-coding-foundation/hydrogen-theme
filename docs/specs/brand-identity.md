# Brand Identity Specification

## Purpose

This spec defines the EVOHERA brand positioning, messaging pillars, visual identity direction, and voice. It ensures consistent brand expression across all touchpoints—store, packaging, marketing, and support.

---

## Positioning Statement

**For** women who feel underserved by generic supplements,  
**EVOHERA** is the stage-specific daily nutrition ritual  
that replaces a complicated pill routine with one delicious drink—  
**because** your biology changes, and your essentials should evolve with you.

---

## Messaging Pillars

| # | Pillar | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Stage-specific by design** | 3 stages, 3 formulas—users self-identify and get the right formula |
| 2 | **Clinically-dosed, not "sprinkled"** | Education-first proof; transparent about what's inside and why |
| 3 | **Enjoyable daily consistency** | Flavor-first ritual; replaces pill fatigue with a drink worth anticipating |
| 4 | **Safety & quality** | cGMP, third-party testing, transparent sourcing |
