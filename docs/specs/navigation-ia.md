# Navigation & Information Architecture Specification

## Purpose

This spec defines the global information architecture and navigation structure for the EVOHERA Shopify store. Stage-based navigation is the primary IA pattern, reducing decision fatigue by letting users self-identify by life stage.

---

## Overview

The store uses a three-group navigation structure: **Explore**, **Learn**, and **Support**. This mirrors a premium, education-led DTC pattern where users can shop by stage, deepen understanding, or get help.

## Navigation Structure

| Group       | Items                                                 | Description                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explore** | Cycle (18–40), Transition (40–55), Thrive (50+)       | Stage-based product discovery; each links to the corresponding product/collection |
| **Learn**   | Stage Guide, Ingredient Glossary, Research Hub (blog) | Education assets that support conversion and SEO                                  |
| **Support** | Help Center, Manage Subscription, Contact             | Post-purchase and customer service                                                |

## Stage-Based Navigation

- **Primary IA pattern**: Users self-identify by life stage (Cycle, Transition, Thrive).
- **Reduces decision fatigue**: "I'm 47 → Transition" creates a clear path.
- **Increases confidence**: Stage-specific content reinforces the right choice.

## Shopify Menu Mapping

| Menu Type       | Structure                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main menu**   | Explore (Cycle, Transition, Thrive) → Learn (Stage Guide, Ingredient Glossary, Research Hub) → Support (Help Center, Manage Subscription, Contact) |
| **Footer menu** | Mirror main structure or simplified; include Support links prominently                                                                             |
