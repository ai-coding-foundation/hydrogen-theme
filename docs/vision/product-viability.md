[![Shop All Products](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.hDJJlW09hcsOm4cTV3MjeQHaHf?pid=Api)](https://biologica.com/pages/shop?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Below is a complete **product viability + product vision + brand strategy + Shopify build spec** for a store *inspired by* the clean, editorial, science-forward experience on Biologica—including the “select your stage” shopping flow, subscription-first economics, and education-led conversion. (You should **not** copy their assets, copy, or exact layouts—this is a fresh brand system that *borrows the interaction patterns and premium feel*.) ([Biologica][1])

---

## 1) What makes that style work (so we can mimic it without copying)

**Key experience principles to recreate:**

* **Hero is one sentence + one CTA** (e.g., “Find your formula”), not a busy banner.
* **Stage-based navigation** as the primary IA (Primary / Midlife / Post) so users self-identify fast. ([Biologica][1])
* **Trust stack is immediate** (doctor formulated, clinically-backed dosages, third-party tested, sugar-free). ([Biologica][1])
* **Education is part of the store, not a blog afterthought**: ingredient glossary + “Hormones 101” + research hub. ([Biologica][2])
* **Subscription is a product feature** (quarterly default + clear savings), not a checkout add-on. ([Biologica][3])

---

## 2) New brand concept (ready to build)

### Brand name (working): **EVOHERA**

**Tagline:** *One daily drink. Built for your stage.*
**Category:** Stage-specific daily supplement drink mix (effervescent sachets in a tin).
**Core promise:** Replace the “7+ pills” routine with one enjoyable, clinically-dosed daily ritual. ([Biologica][1])

### Product line (MVP: 3 SKUs + flavors)

Mirrors the “one product per lifestage” simplicity while being distinct in naming/flavors:

1. **Cycle Essentials (18–40)**

   * Focus: mood steadiness, energy metabolism, digestion, skin support
2. **Transition Essentials (40–55)**

   * Focus: calm, sleep quality, focus/brain fog support, digestion
3. **Thrive Essentials (50+)**

   * Focus: bone support nutrients, cellular antioxidant support, sleep + digestion

**Flavors (2 per SKU at launch):**

* Yuzu Ginger • Blackberry Lime
* Blood Orange Hibiscus • Tart Cherry Pomegranate
  (Use flavor-forward photography like Biologica’s “ritual” feel, but not the same pairings.) ([Biologica][1])

### Offer architecture (how you make the business work)

* **Quarterly subscription** (best value, default selection)
* Monthly subscription
* One-time purchase
* **Starter Bundle:** “Find your stage + pick 2 flavors” (higher AOV, better tasting trial)
* **90-day commitment framing:** “Try for 90 days” to match supplement behavior + reduce churn. ([Biologica][3])

---

## 3) Product viability (why this can win)

### Market tailwinds (demand exists + growing)

* The overall **dietary supplements market is enormous and still growing**, creating space for premium, differentiated DTC brands. ([Grand View Research][4])
* **Women’s health & beauty supplements** is a large segment with continued growth projected. ([Grand View Research][5])
* The broader **menopause market** is projected to grow (and perimenopause is increasingly treated as its own high-intent segment). ([Grand View Research][6])

### Why the model (education + subscription + stage segmentation) converts

* Stage segmentation reduces decision fatigue (“I’m 47 → Transition”) and increases confidence. ([Biologica][1])
* Education assets (glossary, science pages) double as SEO pages that convert. ([Biologica][2])
* Quarterly subscriptions can increase LTV by matching replenishment cadence and lowering “too much product” churn. ([Biologica][3])

### Competitive wedge (how EVOHERA differs)

To avoid being “Biologica but cheaper,” you need one sharp wedge:

* **Wedge option A (best):** “Clinically-dosed *minimalist formulas*” (fewer ingredients, clearer purpose, easier compliance)
* **Wedge option B:** “Symptom-led personalization” (quiz outputs a stage + add-on booster pack later)
* **Wedge option C:** “Ultra-clean GI-first delivery” (gentler minerals, no sweeteners that upset digestion)

### Risk & compliance reality check (important)

* You must avoid disease claims and ensure marketing claims are substantiated; include the standard dietary supplement disclaimer (as Biologica does). ([Biologica][1])
* Build a review + education system that focuses on “supports” language and user experience, not “treats/cures.”

---

## 4) Product vision (12–18 month roadmap)

### V1 (Launch: Weeks 0–10)

* 3 core SKUs, 2 flavors each
* Quiz → result page → recommended product + subscription default
* Ingredient glossary MVP (search + filter by formula)
* 10 “Research Hub” articles (stage-based topics) ([Biologica][7])

### V2 (Months 3–6)

* **Refill economy:** refill pouches (margin + sustainability)
* **Membership layer:** “Ask an expert” monthly Q&A + private community
* **Bundles:** “90-day reset kit” (3 tins) + “Flavor Variety Pack”

### V3 (Months 6–18)

* Add **one adjacent category** only (e.g., “Sleep Support Night Mix” as a single add-on)
* Retail readiness: store locator, wholesale portal, sampling program

---

## 5) Brand strategy (identity that matches the vibe)

### Positioning statement

**For** women who feel underserved by generic supplements,
**EVOHERA** is the stage-specific daily nutrition ritual
that replaces a complicated pill routine with one delicious drink—
**because** your biology changes, and your essentials should evolve with you. ([Biologica][1])

### Messaging pillars (homepage + PDP ready)

1. **Stage-specific by design** (3 stages, 3 formulas) ([Biologica][1])
2. **Clinically-dosed, not “sprinkled”** (education-first proof) ([Biologica][8])
3. **Enjoyable daily consistency** (flavor-first ritual) ([Biologica][1])
4. **Safety & quality** (cGMP, third-party testing, transparent sourcing) ([Biologica][1])

### Visual identity direction (mimic the feel)

* **Typography:** oversized editorial headlines + clean grotesk body copy
* **Layout:** lots of negative space, bold section breaks, crisp icon rows
* **Palette system:** one neutral base + **one hero color per lifestage**

  * Cycle = cool green
  * Transition = deep red
  * Thrive = midnight violet
    (Similar “stage color coding” vibe, but your own tones and assets.)
* **Photography:** macro liquid / ingredient textures + monochrome portraits (advisors), minimal props ([Biologica][1])
* **Packaging motif:** sculptural relief illustration (distinct from theirs), with big type and a single emblem

### Brand voice

* **Calm, direct, science-literate**
* “Here’s what’s inside / here’s why / here’s what to expect” (timeline language works well) ([Biologica][3])
* Never cute, never clinical-cold—**credible warmth**

---

## 6) Shopify store development spec (pages, templates, and components)

Built on Shopify (Online Store 2.0) with custom sections and metaobjects.

### Global IA (navigation)

**Explore**

* Cycle (18–40)
* Transition (40–55)
* Thrive (50+)

**Learn**

* Stage Guide (your “Hormones 101” equivalent)
* Ingredient Glossary
* Research Hub (blog)

**Support**

* Help Center
* Manage Subscription
* Contact

(That mirrors Biologica’s “Explore / Learn / Support” structure.) ([Biologica][1])

---

### Required templates + section modules

#### Home template

1. Hero (H1 + subcopy + CTA “Find Your Stage”)
2. Trust badges row (doctor formulated, clinically dosed, sugar-free, third-party tested) ([Biologica][1])
3. Outcomes icons (mood, energy, digestion, sleep) ([Biologica][1])
4. **Stage selector** (tabs → product cards → quick add) ([Biologica][1])
5. “Made with safety & efficacy” (advisor quotes + testing) ([Biologica][1])
6. Flavor-first section (macro photography) ([Biologica][1])
7. Education preview cards (Stage Guide + Ingredients + Research) ([Biologica][2])
8. Final CTA + email capture

#### Product detail template (PDP)

* Above the fold:

  * Stage tag + product name
  * Benefit bullets
  * Flavor selector
  * **Subscription selector (Quarterly default)** + savings callouts ([Biologica][3])
  * Add to cart + trust icons
* Below:

  * “What to expect” timeline (Week 1, Weeks 2–3, etc.) ([Biologica][3])
  * How to use
  * Supplement Facts (PDF/accordion)
  * “Science & research” callouts (careful: don’t over-claim)
  * “What’s inside” tabbed ingredient groups
  * Comparison table (“How we compare”)
  * Reviews + FAQ

#### Ingredient Glossary

* Search + filter by formula (metaobject-driven) ([Biologica][2])
* Ingredient detail modal/page: what it is, why included, stage relevance, sourcing notes

#### Stage Guide (Hormones 101 equivalent)

* Stage timeline
* “Ingredients you can trust” quality icons (gluten-free, sugar-free, vegetarian, third-party tested) ([Biologica][8])
* Advisory board quotes section (credibility block) ([Biologica][8])

#### Research Hub (blog)

* Filters by stage + ingredient topic ([Biologica][7])
* Strong internal linking: every article → relevant product + glossary items

---

### Shopify data model (so dev is clean)

Use **Metaobjects** for:

* Ingredients (name, description, benefits, evidence notes, included-in formulas, image)
* Clinical callouts (metric, context, disclaimer)
* Advisor profiles (name, title, headshot, quote)
* FAQs (global + per product)
* Flavor variants (notes, pairing, acidity/sweetness scale)

This enables the “education as conversion” system without hardcoding.

---

### Core integrations (keep it lean)

Pick one per category to avoid bloat:

* Email/SMS: Klaviyo
* Subscriptions: Recharge
* Support: Gorgias
* Reviews: Okendo

(These match the subscription + retention-heavy model implied by the reference build.) ([Manufactur][9])

---

## 7) Launch plan (validation → build → growth)

### Pre-validation (before you manufacture big MOQs)

* Landing page + quiz waitlist
* 2–3 paid creative angles (stage-based pain points vs “replace 7 pills”)
* Offer: founders discount + early access flavor vote
* Goal: prove CAC range + stage distribution

### Launch (first 30 days)

* Push quiz as primary CTA everywhere
* 10 core SEO pages:

  * 3 stage pillars
  * 3 product pages
  * 1 ingredient glossary hub
  * 3 “top questions” articles (sleep, mood, energy)

### Retention (day 31–120)

* “What to expect” education sequence (mirrors the timeline approach) ([Biologica][3])
* Quarterly subscription nudges + flavor rotation to reduce fatigue

---

## If you want, I can also provide

* A **Shopify theme section inventory** (exact sections, fields, and settings your dev needs in a build ticket format)
* **Homepage + PDP wireframes** as text blueprints (component by component)
* Full **copy deck** (H1s, PDP bullets, quiz questions, emails)

Just tell me whether your store will be **US-only at launch** and whether you want to sell **powder sachets, gummies, capsules, or drinks** (the strategy stays similar, but PDP + compliance details change).
