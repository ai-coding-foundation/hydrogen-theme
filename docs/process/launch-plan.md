# Launch Plan

## Purpose

Step-by-step launch execution plan from pre-validation through retention, covering the first 120 days.

---

## Phase 1: Pre-validation

_Before manufacturing big MOQs — prove demand and CAC range._

- [ ] Landing page + quiz waitlist live
- [ ] 2–3 paid creative angles tested (stage-based pain points vs "replace 7 pills")
- [ ] Offer: founders discount + early access flavor vote
- [ ] Goal: prove CAC range + stage distribution

---

## Phase 2: Launch (First 30 Days)

_Push quiz as primary CTA; establish core SEO footprint._

- [ ] Push quiz as primary CTA everywhere
- [ ] 10 core SEO pages live:
  - [ ] 3 stage pillar pages
  - [ ] 3 product pages
  - [ ] 1 ingredient glossary hub
  - [ ] 3 "top questions" articles (sleep, mood, energy)

---

## Phase 3: Retention (Day 31–120)

_Education sequences and subscription optimization._

- [ ] "What to expect" education sequence (mirrors timeline approach)
- [ ] Quarterly subscription nudges
- [ ] Flavor rotation to reduce fatigue
