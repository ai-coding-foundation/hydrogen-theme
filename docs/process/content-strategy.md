# Content Strategy

## Purpose

Defines the education-led conversion model, content types, SEO targets, and editorial guidelines for the EVOHERA store.

---

## Core Principle

Education is part of the store, not a blog afterthought. Education assets double as SEO pages that convert.

---

## Content Types

| Type | Description | Location | SEO Role |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Stage Guide | Stage timeline, quality icons, advisory board quotes ("Hormones 101" equivalent) | `/pages/stage-guide` | Pillar page |
| Ingredient Glossary | Search + filter by formula, metaobject-driven ingredient details | `/pages/ingredients` | Hub page with long-tail ingredient pages |
| Research Hub (blog) | Articles filtered by stage + ingredient topic | `/blogs/research` | Supporting content, internal links |

---

## SEO Page Targets (Launch)

| Page Type | Count | Examples |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Stage pillar pages | 3 | Per-stage guides |
| Product pages | 3 | Core SKU pages |
| Ingredient glossary hub | 1 | `/pages/ingredients` |
| "Top questions" articles | 3 | Sleep, mood, energy |
| **Total core pages** | **10** | |

---

## Internal Linking Rules

- Every Research Hub article links to relevant product page + glossary items
- Glossary items link to products containing that ingredient
- Stage Guide links to all products in that stage

---

## Language Guidelines

- Use "supports" language; never "treats" or "cures"
- Focus on user experience and timeline ("what to expect in week 1, weeks 2–3")
- Calm, direct, science-literate tone
