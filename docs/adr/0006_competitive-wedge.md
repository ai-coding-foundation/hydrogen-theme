## Purpose

This ADR records the decision to adopt "clinically-dosed minimalist formulas" as the primary competitive differentiator for EVOHERA, distinguishing the brand from competitors.

- **Status:** ACCEPTED
- **Date:** 2026-02-20
- **Decision Makers:** TBD

## Context

To avoid being "Biologica but cheaper," EVOHERA needs a sharp competitive differentiator. Three options were considered based on market positioning, implementation complexity, and brand alignment.

## Decision

Adopt "Clinically-dosed minimalist formulas" as the primary competitive wedge — fewer ingredients per formula, each at clinically-validated dosages, with a clear purpose per ingredient.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Option A (chosen):** Clinically-dosed minimalist formulas | Clear messaging ("fewer, better"), easier compliance, strong education angle | Perceived as "less" by ingredient-count shoppers |
| **Option B:** Symptom-led personalization (quiz → stage + booster pack) | High personalization, upsell path | Complex to implement, higher SKU count, supply chain burden |
| **Option C:** Ultra-clean GI-first delivery (gentler minerals, no sweeteners) | Niche differentiation, strong for sensitive consumers | Narrower audience, harder to market broadly |

## Consequences

### Positive

- Strong "fewer, better" story
- Aligns with education-first strategy
- Simpler formulation

### Negative

- May not appeal to "kitchen sink" supplement buyers

### Risks

- Competitors can copy the positioning

## Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Aligns with privacy/security specs
- [ ] Aligns with performance budgets
- [ ] No new dependencies without justification
